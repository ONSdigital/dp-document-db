# dp-document-db-spike

POC for running dp CMD apps against AWS DocumentDB instead of MongoDB. 

Contains dockerfile/docker-compose files to run a modified instance of the `dp-recipe-api` against a test DocumentDB 
instance instead of Mongodb using a stubbed auth/identity API in place of Zebedee.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Go >= 1.15
- Go Modules enabled.
- The `ons-web-development.pem` gpg.
- Guide assumes you have already set up a DoumentDB cluster & EC2 instance (see AWS documentation).

Get the code:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ONSdigital/dp-document-db-spike.git
```

### Set up
Set the following environment vars locally:
```bash
# The user/address EC2 instance running the Docdb cluster.
DOC_DB_EC2_ADDR=<USER@ADDRESS>

# The IP address of the EC2 instance in the VPC of the Docdb cluster.
DOC_DB_POC_IP=<IP ADDRESS>
```
SSH on to the EC2 box:
```bash
make ssh
```

Set the following environment vars have been set on the EC2 instance:

```bash
# The DocumentDB instance URL:PORT - see AWS console.
MONGODB_HOST=<URL:PORT>

# The DocumentDB instance username - see AWS console.
MONGODB_USERNAME=<USERNAME>>

# The DocumentDB instance password - see AWS console.
MONGODB_PASSWORD=<THE_PASSWORD>

# The path the cert file need to connect to the DocumentDB instance - see AWS console.
MONGODB_CERT=rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem

# Enable human log format for the Go apps. 
HUMAN_LOG=1

# The Zebedee stub URL to use (use this value - **"api-stub"** is the container name in the docker-compose.yml)
ZEBEDEE_URL=http://api-stub:8082

# Flag to configure the recipe API to use DocumentDB instead of standard Mongo.
MONGODB_IS_DOC_DB=true
```
Exit the SSH connection.

### Install on EC2 and run the demo

1) Package the POC binaries & docker config and SCP them on to the EC2 instance:
    ```
    make install
    ```

2) SSH onto the box:
    ```
    make ssh
    ```

3) Run the install script from the home dir:
    ```
    ./install.sh
    ```
    This will stop and clean up any existing running containers, build and start new containers using the latest 
    binaries version using docker-compose. To check the app logs run `docker logs -f <container_name>`. Exit SSH session.

4) Assuming everything has been installed & configured correctly you should now be able run the demo app. From the project root dir locally run:
   ```
   make example
   ```
   This will POST a new recipe request to the recipe API (which is now running against DocumentDB) & then send a GET request to retrieve it 
   by ID and pretty print the response JSON in the console. You should see output similar to:
   
   ```bash
